•Y: Y-axis spatial coordinate within the Montesinho park map: 2 to 9

•month: Month of the year: 'jan' to 'dec'

•day: Day of the week: 'mon' to 'sun'

•FFMC: Fine Fuel Moisture Code index from the FWI system: 18.7 to 96.20

•DMC: Duff Moisture Code index from the FWI system: 1.1 to 291.3

•DC: Drought Code index from the FWI system: 7.9 to 860.6

•ISI: Initial Spread Index from the FWI system: 0.0 to 56.10

•temp: Temperature in Celsius degrees: 2.2 to 33.30

•RH: Relative humidity in percentage: 15.0 to 100

•wind: Wind speed in km/h: 0.40 to 9.40
•rain: Outside rain in mm/m2 : 0.0 to 6.4

•area: The burned area of the forest (in ha): 0.00 to 1090.84



2.The dataset contains 36733 instances of 11 sensor measures aggregated over one hour (by means of average or sum) from a gas turbine. 
The Dataset includes gas turbine parameters (such as Turbine Inlet Temperature and Compressor Discharge pressure) in addition to the ambient variables.



Problem statement: predicting turbine energy yield (TEY) using ambient variables as features.
